# SalesScanningSystem
A project for a point-of-sale scanning system that accepts an arbitrary ordering of products, similar to what would happen at an actual checkout line, then returns the correct total price for an entire shopping cart based on per-unit or volume prices as applicable.

Sales Scanning System is the class library which implements all the business logics.

ScanningSystem_Test is the N-unit test library to test basic business logics.

StoreScanningSystem_UI is the front view for scanning products.
